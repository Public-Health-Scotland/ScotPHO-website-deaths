Edman - practice chart showing annual changes in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in Scotland, in weeks and years.

This chart uses the script that creates the Hepatitis C chart here: https://www.scotpho.org.uk/health-wellbeing-and-disease/hepatitis-c/data/scotland-and-uk/

Annual changes in life expectancy in Scotland figures are on this page: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/life-expectancy/life-expectancy-in-scotland/2018-2020 > All Figures > Figure 3 data.  

Annual changes in healthy life expectancy in Scotland figures over the last decade are on this page: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/life-expectancy/healthy-life-expectancy-in-scotland/2018-2020 > Data and Charts > Figure 3 data. 

Have not been able to change 'Sex' select box input to a checkbox group input. Y axis titles are not displaying correctly.

Could do with the data lines stating if the figure is in years or weeks.
